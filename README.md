# Counting-Application
This is a counting application that when clicked into waits for keystrokes on a keyboard to count upwards. I built it primarily for shiny hunting but it can be used for anything that needs counting. It also writes out to a file so that you can keep track of the number and tie it to a layout for streaming.
